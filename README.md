# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Big data & Google Colabs 

One of the interesting components of the cdlass is getting to know so many different programs and ways to do similar things. I think it's fascinating how there are several different ways to approach a project and getting to understand it. For this project we have been using google colabs, amazon warehouse, postgresql. 
I examined pet product reviews from amazon & looked to see which was more popular, paid reviews, or unpaid reviews. 

## Method 
I setup place to house my data on Amazon warehouse. I was able to store & retrieve my initial data set directly from this external server. 
Google Colabs served as my interface where I was able to play with the data to examine the contents of the reviews.

83% of the highly rated reviews were unpaid leading me to believe that the reviewer's are providing more accurate feedback in their reviews and are able to better understand the consumer experience and target customer audience than a paid reviewer. It was fascinating to see what a small percentage of the overall reviews were actually paid. 
I originally thought there would be more paid reviews but a suprisingly large number of people left unpaid reviews. It makes me wonder what their motivation is. I know I rely on reviews when making purchases myself, but I rarely take the time to review products. It makes me wonder how motivated people are to review items and what drives the willingness to document a product's features for strangers to better understand what they're getting themselves into.
